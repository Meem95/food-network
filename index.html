            <h3>Sunday Chili</h3>
            <p>It’s thick and appropriately chunky, spicy and extremely flavorful without being hot, balanced just right between meat, beans, and vegetables, and excellently scoopable (what else is chili for, really). And not to mention it does that chili magic thing where it GETS BETTER AS LEFTOVERS.</p>

            <h3>Creamy Summer Salad</h3>
            <p>What started as a summer panzanella salad magically morphed into the most zingy, fresh, delicious, creamy summer salad on the block. We swapped bread croutons for super flavorful Crispy BBQ Chickpeas (optional but recommended), which add plenty of plant-based protein and fiber.</p>
